## Icon

Use the Icon Component to provide subtle graphical information to the user that, in some cases, may also trigger simple interactions such as liking a product, saving an article for later, etc. You may choose between the already provided [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) or add the ones you need to the list of available ones in the Styling library. The Icon is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Icon Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/icon.html)

### Styling

The Icon comes with styling flexibility through the overrides for selectable graphic and the color used to fill it.

## Usage

Carefully pick the Icon color to assure good contrast with the background and definitely avoid similar shades of the same color or combinations that create chromatic aberrations.

## Code generation

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Icon in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Icon.
