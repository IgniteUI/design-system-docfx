## Switch

Use the Switch Component to allow the user make a selection, which most often expresses turning on/off a configuration in a list of settings. The Switch is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Switch Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/switch.html)

### Switch Demo

### Theme

The Switch can be used styled in **dark** and light variants to assure good readability and contrast for both lighter and darker backgrounds.

### Label use

The Switch is used **with** or without label. In order to hide the label, set its text value to a blank/space character and reduce the width of the component to e.g. 38px.

### State

The Checkbox provides **on** and off selection states with additional variants for a disabled interaction state.

### Styling

The Switch comes with styling flexibility, allowing control over the thumb and track colors. There is a fixed alpha value applied to the track to make it semi transparent.

## Usage

The Switch should appear to the right of the label describing the option, in regard to whose state it controls, in a list of settings. Avoid placing it near the left edge of the screen, and if that is absolutely necessary for a reason, please use a Checkbox instead. Also, use the same or very similar colors for the Switch thumb and track.

## Code generation

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Switch in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Switch.
