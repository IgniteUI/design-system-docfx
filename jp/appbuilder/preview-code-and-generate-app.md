# Preview code and generate app  

The Indigo Design App Builder always displays a live-running web application both on the design surface and in the preview window. The underlying code and application model are updated in real time as you make changes to the application in the design surface. You can view the generated application code at any time in the preview window and you can also download the generated application at any time as a complete application code repository, which you can then open in a code editor of your choice. Then you can build and run the application you've designed using the Indigo Design App Builder locally on your machine and you can make additional modifications on the generated code.  

## Preview code  

 TODO: Update content

The preview mode allows you to interact with your design as-if it's a running app. For instance, you can resize the viewport to see how the positioning for components behave. But the real value it offers to developers is to preview the code generated for each view. To see this, you can toggle the code-view ON and see it side-by-side with the design. It's in read-only mode, but  will help you review the quality of code produced.  

The code view allows you to see the HTML, CSS and TS separately. And this saves time by sparing you the effort to write markup and CSS to create something that's pixel perfect. The generated code makes use of real developer components, in this case, Ignite UI for Angular, so you can be assured that there is comprehensive developer documentation to back it up. 

Moreover, you are skipping the hand-off where developers have to inspect the visual assets to extract visual specifications.  

## Compile and Run the app  

 TODO: Update content

To finally develop the app, you don't need to copy paste code. Instead use the generate app button in the toolbar. This creates an Angular application that can be downloaded. To run this app, open up the folder in an IDE like visual studio code.  

 * Make sure you have Node.js installed. 
 * Then in the console, type `npm install` to install the dependencies. It takes a while to install this, but we don't control this part.  
 * Once that is done, type `npm start` to compile and launch the app. 

With the ability to create your designs visually using professional grade components in the editor, and then being able to generate an Angular app you can freely extend in your IDE offers you the best of both worlds. In the end, you are guaranteed that what you designed is exactly how it looks when the app is built. Don't forget to share your feedback using the feedback button. We look forward to hearing about your experience and also about what features are valuable to you as we move forwards to our next release milestone in the coming months.
