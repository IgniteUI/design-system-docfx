# Installing the Visual Code Extension

Before you can install the VS Code Extension, please make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed. To generate code and run Angular apps, you also need Node.js installed. You can get both from the links here:

1.  NodeJS: [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install
2.  Visual Studio Code: [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install

## Step-by-Step

1.  Once Visual Studio Code is open, select "View" then "Extensions" from the main menu
