## Hyperlink

Use the Hyperlink Component Symbol to allow the user access additional information related to a styled piece of text in a paragraph such as the mentioning of the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy in a form.

## Usage

Always choose a Hyperlink text color that makes it stand out in a paragraph. Avoid using the same color or similar nuances of it and pick a consistent color across your complete design.
