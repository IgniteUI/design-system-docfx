# Hyperlink

Use the Hyperlink Component to allow the user access additional information related to a styled piece of text in a paragraph like the mentioning of the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy in a form.

## Hyperlink Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_demo.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Size

The Hyperlink comes in two different sizes matching the available sizes for paragraph text: Body 1 and Body 2.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_sizes.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_sizes@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Hyperlink can be styled through the Styling library by changing its default blue color to another one, and you can change the URL and text.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_styling.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_styling@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

Always choose a Hyperlink text color that makes it stand out in a paragraph. Avoid using the same color or similar nuances of it and pick a consistent color across your complete design.
