## Grid

Use the Grid Component to let the user browse and interact with vast amount of complex data that is visually represented in tabular fashion and provide means for filtering, sorting, paging, and much more. The Grid is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid.html)

### Detach from Symbol

The Grid is essentially a repeater of columns and rows showing data in a tabular fashion. Therefore, the easiest way to use it is by dragging one of the predefined grids to your artboard - there are three presets available for the three [display densities](grid-display-density.md) supported. Once in your artboard, by right clicking on top of it, and selecting the `Detach from Symbol` option near the bottom of the contextual menu you should see the following in your layers panel under the newly appeared group:

| Layer                                    | Use                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üö´ igx-grid/_(comfortable/cosy/compact)_ | A special locked layer starting with a prohibited icon. This layer is required by the code generation and you should avoid deleting or modifying it. |
| Header                                   | Contains all the cells in the header                                                                                                                 |
| Body                                     | Contains all the cells in the body                                                                                                                   |
| üïπÔ∏èPrimaryKey                             | Reference for the column with the primary keys of the records that is required by some Grid features and is used by the code generation engine       |
| üïπÔ∏èDataSource                             | Reference for the data source that the Grid will be bound to that is used by the code generation engine                                              |

After detaching, you may alter the number of headers you need, in order to show all the dimensions of your data and insert as many visible records as you want to show in your design simply by duplicating one of the rows of data that you already have.

### Cell Types

The Grid provides three types of cells serving different data visualization purposes. The Header Cell is only one per column and appears at the top of the grid to display the textual description of the data in that particular column. The Body Cell is used to build the content table displaying data records and its type may vary. The Summary Cell is used to create a section at the bottom of the Grid where [Summaries](grid-summaries.md) columns are displayed for each dimension such as count, minimum, and maximum value.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_summary.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_summary@2x.png 2x" />

There is also one special sub-type of Header Cell, the Row Filter Header Cell that is used to create an additional Header row at the bottom of the Header in order to enable the [Row Filtering](grid-row-filter.md) functionality.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_filter.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_filter@2x.png 2x" />

### Cell Display Density

Header, Body and Summary Cells support the the three display density variants of the Grid and come with distinct symbols for each one as can be seen for the Body Cells below:

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_comfortable.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_comfortable@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_cosy.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_cosy@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_compact.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_compact@2x.png 2x" />

### Items and Features (Header Cell)

The Grid Header Cell supports various layout combinations through the `Items` override and different feature configurations via the `Feature Left` and `Feature Right` overrides. Moreover there are a number of additional overrides that are not visible but enable different column features on the Grid, such as [Editing](grid-editing.md), [Moving](grid-column-moving.md), [Resizing](grid-column-resizing.md), and [Hiding](grid-column-hiding.md).

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_no-icon.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_no-icon@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_icon.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_icon@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_icons.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_icons@2x.png 2x" />

### State and Grid Feature (Body Cell)

The Grid Body Cell supports the following interactive states: **inactive** for the normal state and active for the focused/selected cell.
_Default value is styled with_ **bold** _text._

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_cell-inactive.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_cell-inactive@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_cell-active.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_cell-active@2x.png 2x" />

The Grid Body Cell has styling support for some of the Grid features defined through the headers via the `Grid Feature` override that gives access to cells styled for regular cells, editable cells and cells that belong to a selected row.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_row-editing-focus.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_row-editing-focus@2x.png 2x" />

### Cell Type

The Grid Header Cell provides presets for the three generic types of data that the Grid needs to accommodate: **Number** for numeric values, Text for strings, and Checbox that is usually used for columns with boolean data or as a template for the first column in order to allow selection of multiple rows.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_number.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_number@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_text.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_text@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_header_checkbox.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_header_checkbox@2x.png 2x" />

The Grid Body Cell provides presets for the same generic types of data like the Header Cell with an additional icon type to visualize simple graphics.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_number.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_number@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_text.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_text@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_checkbox.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_checkbox@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_cell_body_icon.png" srcset="../images/grid_cell_body_icon@2x.png 2x" />

### Grid Horizontal Scrolling

One way to achieve certain Grid dimensions, either as an absolute width or in relation to a parent group/container, is by adding a mask within the main group for the Grid. Simply insert a rectangle without any style and set its dimensions according to your needs, in the image below we have a Grid that is always exactly 800px wide.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_horizontal_scroll_rect.png" srcset="../images/grid_horizontal_scroll_rect@2x.png 2x" />

You may fix the width and height of the rectangle, change its name to `Mask` and position it just above the special symbol `üïπÔ∏èDataSource` in the layers panel. Then right click on top of it and select the `Mask` option near the bottom of the contextual menu.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/grid_horizontal_scroll_masked.png" srcset="../images/grid_horizontal_scroll_masked@2x.png 2x" />

Now your Grid group will take the dimensions of the Mask and you may use it in your layout in the same way as you would use a Grid without horizontal scrolling. When code for this component is generated it will automatically add a horizontal scrollbar respecting the mask dimensions as dimension for your Grid.

### Styling

The Grid comes with styling flexibility achievable through styling the individual cell text, icons, and background colors in the various states available, as well as the hiding of horizontal and vertical borders.

## Usage

The most important thing about the Grid is the alignment of the data inside its Header and Body Cells. Text should always be aligned left, leaving variable empty space to the right, and numbers should always be aligned right, leaving variable empty space to the left.

## Code generation

This section describes some important overrides and how they affect code generation.

> [!WARNING]
> The grid **must** be a detached symbol to be able to be used.

> [!NOTE]
> The height of the grid is set to `100%` as the default.

### Data Source Property

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èDataSource` value is used to set up the data source for the grid and needs to be an array of objects, where each column name is a property on the object. If the data source is not supplied, the grid will only render the column headers.

### Primary Key

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èPrimaryKey` is used to set the `primaryKey` property on the grid. The value of this property should be the name of a property in the data source that contains unique values. This property is especially important if you wish to use the [row editing banner](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/row_editing.html) in the grid.

### Header

When supplied, the Headers help determine the number of columns to be rendered. It will try and pair a Header with a Body (Cell) that is below it to form the column. If no matching Body can be found, a column will be created based on the information that can be gathered from the Header. When a pair is found, information will be gathered from the Header first then the Body/Cell.

The Header has some sizing options available to it. If you pin each header cell to the left and right in Sketch, it will force the column to generate with a percentage width in HTML. This will allow the column to grow or shrink depending on the size of the Grid. Alternatively, you can fix the Header cell width which will generate a fixed column of that size.

#### Type

When supplied this is used to determine the type of the column (string, number, Boolean).

#### Text

The‚ÄØHeader Text property may contain text, [binding text](../codegen/data-binding.md), or a combination of the two, examples:

- Settings
- {settingsLabel}
- Important {labelText}

#### Feature Left & Feature Right

These overrides control what features are enabled for the individual columns. The following values are available:

- None (Default)
- Filtering ([Excel Style Filtering](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/excel_style_filtering.html))
- Pinning
- Sorting

#### Column Moving

This override determines whether the column is movable or not by the user.

#### Column Resizing

This override determines whether the column is resizable or not by the user.

#### Column Hiding

This override determines whether the column is hidden or not.

### Body/Cell

When supplied, the Bodies (cells) help determine the number of columns to be rendered. It will try and pair a Header with a Body (Cell). If no matching Header can be found a column will be created based on the information that can be gathered from the Body/Cell. When a pair is found information will be gathered from the Header first then the Body/Cell.

#### Data Property

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is used to setup the field of the column, which should correspond to a field in the `üïπÔ∏èDataSource`.

#### Type

When supplied this is used to determine the type of the column (string, number, Boolean).
