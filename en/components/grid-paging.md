## Grid Paging

Use the Grid Paging Component Symbol to inform the user about his current posiiton and allow navigation to the previous/next and first/last pages of content for the Grid. Position the Grid Paging immediately below the Grid without any gap between the two.
The Grid Paging is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Paging Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid_paging.html)
