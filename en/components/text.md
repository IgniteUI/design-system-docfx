## Text

Use the Text Component Symbol to display the content of a title or paragraph string that is not interactive, such as the content of a news article or blog post.

### Text Demo

### Paragraph Sizes

Text Paragraphs come in three preset sizes: a larger **Body 1**, a smaller Body 2, and a tiny Caption used to annotate images and titles.

### Styling

Titles and Paragraphs come with constrained styling flexibility, allowing only to choose from the text weight and color presets available in the Typography portion of the Styling library.

## Usage

Always choose Paragraph text color that makes a Hyperlink stand out if the two are used together. Avoid using the same color or similar nuances of it and pick consistent Title and Paragraph colors across your complete design. Use the Paragraph Caption size only for one-line annotations and avoid using such tiny font sizes for longer, multi-line strings.

## Code generation

When colors or fonts are specified for the Title or Paragraph, they are applied directly to a CSS class that is applied to the title or paragraph element.

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Title or Paragraph Text in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Title or Paragraph Text.

### Data Bindings

Data bindings are specified by using curly brace syntax, example: {isAdmin}. Text fields (not `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` or `üïπÔ∏èDataSource`) also support string interpolation syntax example: Admin: {isAdmin}. Data bindings can be non-nested or nested. If the target property is a nested property, include the nested property chain, but don‚Äôt include the model object name. Examples:

#### Not Nested

```typescript
Customer {
  imageName: String;
}
```
DataProperty would be: `{imageName}`

#### Nested

```typescript
Profile {
  imageName: String;
}

Customer {
  profile: Profile;
}
```
DataProperty would be: `{profile.imageName}`

### Text

The‚ÄØText property may contain text, binding, or a combination of the two, examples:

- Settings
- {settingsLabel}
- Important {labelText}
