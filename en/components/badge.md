## Badge

Use the Badge Component Symbol to draw attention to another interface element or to display a notification. It enhances the component to which it is attached with additional information, disclosed to the user upon iteracting with it. The Badge is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Badge Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/badge.html)

### Badge Demo

### Shape

The Badge comes in two distinct shapes: round and square.

<img src="../images/badge_shapes.png" srcset="../images/badge_shapes@2x.png 2x" />

### Type

The Badge can carry different types of content such as a **number** or an icon.

### Styling

The Badge comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling the background and border colors, as well as the presence of a shadow that is cast on the underlying interface element.

## Usage

Use the Badge to "stamp" another piece of UI, such as an Avatar or a text title and avoid using the Badge on its own.

## Code Generation

When colors or fonts are specified for the Badge, the Badge HTML element will be wrapped in a div. This is required by browsers to style a nested component (a component within another component).

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Badge in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Badge.

### Data Bindings

Data bindings are specified by using curly brace syntax, example: {isAdmin}. Text fields (not `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` or `üïπÔ∏èDataSource`) also support string interpolation syntax example: Admin: {isAdmin}. Data bindings can be non-nested or nested. If the target property is a nested property, include the nested property chain, but don‚Äôt include the model object name. Examples:

#### Not Nested

```typescript
Customer {
  imageName: String;
}
```

DataProperty would be: `{imageName}`

#### Nested

```typescript
Profile {
  imageName: String;
}

Customer {
  profile: Profile;
}
```

DataProperty would be: `{profile.imageName}`

### Event Property

When supplied the `üïπÔ∏èEvent` property is used to create a method in the component TypeScript and add an Angular click signature in the HTML. When supplied the event must be specified using the curly braces format: {onEventName}.

### Data Property

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` value is used to set up a data binding to the badge value property. The `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is optional. The `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is the name of the property on the data object specified by the model object name provided in the generation request. When the badge type is Icon, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is ignored.

### Type

Determines if the badge is a number/text or an icon badge.

### Text

When the Type is set to Number the following is applied:

- If a `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is supplied the value will be data bound to the specified property.
- If Text has a data binding, the value will be data bound to the specified property.
- If Text has a value, the value will be set to the text.
