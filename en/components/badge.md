# Badge

Use the Badge Component Symbol to draw attention to another interface element or to display a notification. It enhances the component to which it is attached with additional information, disclosed to the user upon interacting with it. The Badge is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Badge Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/badge.html)

## Badge Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/badge_demo.png" srcset="../images/badge_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Type

The Badge can carry different types of content such as a **number** or an **icon**.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/badge_type.png" srcset="../images/badge_type@2x.png 2x" />

## Shape

The Badge comes in two distinct shapes: **round** and **square**.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/badge_shapes.png" srcset="../images/badge_shapes@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Badge comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling the background and border colors, as well as the presence of a shadow that is cast on the underlying interface element, the icon with its color, and the text with its style where applicable.

## Usage

Use the Badge to "stamp" another piece of UI, such as an Avatar or a text title and avoid using the Badge on its own.

## Code Generation

This section describes some important overrides and how they affect code generation.

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Badge in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Badge.

### Event Property

When supplied the `üïπÔ∏èEvent` property is used to create a method in the component TypeScript and add an Angular click signature in the HTML. When supplied the event must be specified using the curly braces format: {onEventName}.

### Data Property

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` value is used to set up a [data binding](../codegen/data-binding.md) to the badge value property. It is the name of the property on the data object specified by the model object name provided during code generation. As such, it is required that if the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is used that the model object name must be specified otherwise it will be ignored.

When the badge type is Icon, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is ignored.

### Type

Determines if the badge is a number/text or an icon badge.

### Text

When the Type is set to Number the following is applied:

- If a `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is supplied the value will be [data bound](../codegen/data-binding.md) to the specified property.
- If Text has a data binding, the value will be data bound to the specified property.
- If Text has a value, the value will be set to the text.
