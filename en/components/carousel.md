## Carousel

Use the Carousel Component to let the user navigate through a collection of images in a sequential fashion, moving to the previous/next one through the arrows on the sides. The Carousel is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Carousel Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/carousel.html)

### Carousel Demo

<img src="../images/carousel_demo.png" srcset="../images/carousel_demo@2x.png 2x" />

### Styling

The Carousel comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling the navigation button background and icon colors, the indicator colors, border colors, and a slide image for the currently active slide. You should keep in mind that only one indicator may be active at a time.

## Usage

The previous and next navigation buttons of the Carousel should always appear on top of the image slide, and the indicators should have consistent styling, where only the active one should be emphasized.

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| <img src="../images/carousel_do1.png" srcset="../images/carousel_do1@2x.png 2x" /> | <img src="../images/carousel_dont1.png" srcset="../images/carousel_dont1@2x.png 2x" /> |
| <img src="../images/carousel_do2.png" srcset="../images/carousel_do2@2x.png 2x" /> | <img src="../images/carousel_dont2.png" srcset="../images/carousel_dont2@2x.png 2x" /> |

## Code generation

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Carousel in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Carousel.
