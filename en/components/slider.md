## Slider

Use the Slider Component to allow the user to select a single value or specify a range of values by choosing values for both its ends. The Slider is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Slider Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/slider.html)

### Slider Demo

### Theme

The Slider can be used styled in **dark** or light theme to assure good readability and contrast for both lighter and darker backgrounds.

### Styling

The Slider comes with styling flexibility through the overrides for the label background, thumb, track, and base track colors.

## Usage

The Slider track color should always have a higher emphasis than the track base color. Both single value and range Sliders should be consistently styled i.e. the label background should match the thumb and track color.

## Code generation
