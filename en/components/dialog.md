## Dialog

Use the Dialog Component Symbol to show a message or alert to the user, allowing him to take action accordingly or to present a form that requires immediate action before proceeding, such as a login. The Dialog is displayed modally, meaning that the user has to complete or close it before moving on.
The Dialog is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Dialog Window Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/dialog.html)

The Dialog comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides for its title and message, as well as the buttons at the bottom that individually styled as flat or raised with all the styling options that these two [Button](button.md) types provide.

## Usage

When designing a custom content Dialog avoid placing buttons in the content section and use the existing dialog buttons for your actions instead.

The Bottom Navigation symbol has a special `üïπÔ∏èDataSource` field in its `Overrides` section. Use the curly braces notation _{notifications.count}_ to provide a reference for code generation to the database property, which should be used as a binding.
