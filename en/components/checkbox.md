## Checkbox

Use the Checkbox Component Symbol to allow the user make a selection, which most often expresses a preference or agreement in a form.
The Checkbox is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Checkbox Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/checkbox.html)

## Usage

When many Checkboxes are necessary arrange them in a column group which makes it really easy to scan quickly through the list. Fewer checkboxes may also be aranged on a single line next to each other but avoid arrangements in multiple columns.

The Bottom Navigation symbol has a special `üïπÔ∏èDataSource` field in its `Overrides` section. Use the curly braces notation _{notifications.count}_ to provide a reference for code generation to the database property, which should be used as a binding.
