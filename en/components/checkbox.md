## Checkbox

Use the Checkbox Component to allow the user make a selection, which most often expresses a preference or agreement in a form. The Checkbox is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Checkbox Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/checkbox.html)

### Checkbox Demo

<img src="../images/checkbox_demo.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_demo@2x.png 2x" />

### Theme

The Checkbox can be used styled in **dark** and light variants to assure good readability and contrast for both lighter and darker backgrounds.

<img src="../images/checkbox_dark.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_dark@2x.png 2x" />
<img src="../images/checkbox_light.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_light@2x.png 2x" />

### State

The Checkbox provides **on**, off, and indeterminate selection states with additional variants for a disabled interaction state.

### Styling

The Checkbox comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling its check and fill colors, as well as the label text color.

## Usage

When many Checkboxes are necessary, you'll want to arrange them in a column group which makes it really easy to scan quickly through the list. Fewer Checkboxes may also be arranged on a single line next to each other but you should avoid arrangements in multiple columns.

## Code Generation

This section describes some important overrides and how they affect code generation.

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Checkbox in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Checkbox.

### Data Property

When supplied, the `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` value is used to set up a two-way [data binding](../codegen/data-binding.md) using [Angular Reactive Forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) to the checkbox's checked property. The `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is optional. The `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` is the name of the property on the data object specified by the model object name provided during code generation.

When both a model object name and `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` are provided, the TypeScript `ngOnInit` method with be populated with form builder code to create the Reactive Forms form. The `üïπÔ∏èDataProperty` will be used to populate the formControlName property on the checkbox control.

### Theme

Theme specified the theme the checkbox will use, either Dark or Light theme. When Theme is None, the control will not render.

### State

The State is used by the designer to represent checkboxes in different states in the design. If the State is **not** On, the checkbox will not render. An On State is required to be able to discover the check and fill properties from the Sketch drawing for the checkbox.

### Text

The‚ÄØText property may contain text, [binding text](../codegen/data-binding.md), or a combination of the two, examples:

- Settings
- {settingsLabel}
- Important {labelText}
