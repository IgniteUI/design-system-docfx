Previewing generated code and downloading your work as an Angular app is the final step after designing one application. The design and development user story will be completed once the application is generated with all styiling and layout properties.

## Preview Code 

The preview mode allows you to interact with your design as-if it's a running app. For instance, you can resize the viewport to see how the positioning for components behave. But the real value it offers to developers is to preview the app code that is about to be generated. To see this, you can toggle the code-view ON and see it side-by-side with the design. It's in read-only mode, but  will help you review the quality of code produced.

The code view allows you to see the HTML, CSS and TS separately. And this saves time by sparing you the effort to write markup and CSS to create something that's pixel perfect. The generated code makes use of real developer components, in this case, Ignite UI for Angular, so you can be assured that there is comprehensive developer documentation to back it up.
Moreover, you are skipping the hand-off where developers have to inspect the visual assets to extract visual specifications which usually requires a lot of communication between designers and developers and includes multiple rounds of polishing one design.

## Run the app 
To finally develop the app, you don't need to copy paste code. Instead use the generate app button in the toolbar. This quickly creates a package with your Angular application that can be downloaded. To run this app, open up the folder in an IDE like visual studio code. 

•	Make sure you have Node.js installed. <br>
•	Then in the console, type `npm install` to install the dependencies. It takes a while to install this, but we don't control this part. <br>
•	Once that is done, type `npm start` to compile and launch the app.<br>

With the ability to create your designs visually using professional grade components in the editor, and then being able to generate an Angular app you can freely extend in your IDE offers you the best of both worlds. In the end, you are guaranteed that what you designed is exactly how it looks when the app is built. Don't forget to share your feedback using the feedback button. We look forward to hearing about your experience and also about what features are valuable to you as we move forwards to our next release milestone in the coming months.
