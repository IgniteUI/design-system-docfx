# Getting started with Indigo Design App Builder

What you'll see when you launch the [Indigo Design App Builder]({environment:infragisticsBaseUrl}/products/indigo-design/app-builder) for first time is a pop up window suggesting a quick onboarding tour. What you will see next is the create new project dialog. You can either use one of predefined layouts or edit one of our prebuilt getting started apps. The getting started apps will help you explore applications that have been created using the Indigo Design App Builder and also allow you to modify them in your own user space. They are also a good source for you to preview generated code for a larger application without having to create your own app from scratch. If you use the Indigo Design App Builder for first time, we recommend to use the sample app option as a starting point. This is the quickest way to onboard yourself with the awesome features of the tool and to start building your application.

## Getting the code
The Indigo Design App Builder always displays a live-running web application both on the design surface and in the preview window. The underlying code and application model are updated in real time as you make changes to the application in the design surface. You can view the generated application code at any time in the preview window and you can also download the generated application at any time as a complete application code repository, which you can then open in a code editor of your choice. Then you can build and run the application you've designed using the Indigo Design App Builder locally on your machine and you can make additional modifications on the generated code.  git fetch
