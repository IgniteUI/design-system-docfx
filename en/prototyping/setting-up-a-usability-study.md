<br/>

2. Optionally, add welcome and thank you messages.The welcome message is what your participants will see before starting the study. For the thank you page content you can suggest future actions for participants completing the study. For example, asking them to go complete a post-study survey.

### 2. Define tasks

You need at least one task to start a usability test.

1. To add a task, click on `new task`. Then, add a description.

<br/>

2. Define the expected path for completing the task by interacting with the prototype. If you make a mistake, you can always undo the last step.

<br/>

3. When you are done recording the path, use the `new task` option to add more. If you are done adding tasks, go ahead and invite participants.
    
### 3. Invite participants

To invite participants, click `Start Testing` option in the main toolbar. Then, share the generated URL let them take part using their web-browser.

When you are happy with the number of participants, you can use the `Stop Testing` option to prevent additional sessions.
