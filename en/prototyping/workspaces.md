##  Collaborating with Workspaces

Use group workspaces to collaborate with your teammates on the same prototypes and usability studies. Members can publish and replace any design in the workspace. And if a member leaves, the rest will still have access to what's in the workspace.

### Creating a Group Workspace

Expand the workspaces dropdown and click the `+ new group` option.

Type a name for your workspace. 

Add members by typing their email address. 
If you already share workspaces with them, they'll show up on a list. You can select them from the list and they'll become a member immediately. Otherwise, they'll get an invite to join the workspace via email.

### Accessing a Workspace

Expand the workspaces dropdown and select the name of the workspace you want to work on.
You'll see all the prototypes and usability tests belonging to that workspace.


### Publishing to a Group Workspace

Once you select a workspace, any prototypes you create and publish will belong to that workspace. 

> [!Note]
>You can choose any prototype and use the `Copy to workspace` action to make a copy of that prototype in a different workspace.

### Managing Group Workspaces

Select the workspace from the workspaces dropdown and then click on `settings` in the main toolbar area.
