##  Collabrating with Workspaces

Use group workspaces to collaborate with your teammates on the same prototypes and usability studies. Members can publish and replace any design in the workspace. And if a member leaves, the rest will still have access to what's in the workspace.

Watch our videos on [how to create group workspaces][video-1] and [how to collaborate using group workspaces][video-2].

### Creating a group workspace

Expand the workspaces dropdown and click the `Create a group workspace` option.

<div class="divider--half"></div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>

Type a name for your workspace. 

Add members by typing their email address. 
If you already share workspaces with them, they'll show up on a list. You can select them from the list and they'll become a member immediately.
Otherwise, they'll get an invite to join the workspace via email.

### Accessing a workspace

Expand the workspaces dropdown and select the name of the workspace you want to work on.
You'll see all the prototypes belonging to that workspace.


### Publishing to a group workspace

Once you select a workspace, any prototypes you create and publish will belong to that workspace. 

> [!Note]
>You can choose any prototype and use the `Copy to workspace` action to make a copy of that share in a different workspace.

### Managing group workspaces

Select the workspace from the workspaces dropdown and click on the gear icon.

<div class="divider--half"></div>
