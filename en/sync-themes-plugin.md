## Sync Theme Plugin

### 1. Best Practices

This topic provides guidence and best practices regarding theme editing of Indigo.Design UI kit according to users' brand requirements. By sticking to the recommendations below you will be able to apply your primary brand assets, such as typography and brand colors, to Indigo.Design Sketch UI kit, so that all components will hold your brand requirements.


### 2. Launching the Sync Themes Plugin

**3.1 Naming your New Theme**

First, you have to specify Theme name, then edit Colors and Typography properties.

**3.2 Specify colors**

You can specify Primary.500 and Secondary.500 (you can apply your brand colors here) and their shades will be generated automatically. In order to edit a color, you have to click on it and type the HEX or RGB value or select color manually from the color palette. As to Warning, Info, Error, Success colors, we strongly recommend to take in mind the perception of the application user for Warning, Info, Error, Success use cases. That's why we provided default colors, which we find meaningful for the cases that are going to be used.

**3.3 Specify typography**

As to the font the user can define font properties from the Typography tab. First, has to be selected Base Typaface from the font menu, then define font weight for the provided text styles. These text styles are applied not only to the text fields, but also on components such as chips, inputs, avatars and many others. The user is restricted from editing the font size, because of the negative impact that it may have on the components using some of these font styles.

###4. Use existing theme

Instead of starting your own theme, you can also use some of the existing themes provided or added by you, as an user. You can directly apply the theme, edit it before using or delete it.

**4.1 Editing theme name, colors and typography**

If you choose to edit the existing theme before applying, you are allowed to rename the theme and edit its default Primary and Secondary color and Typography according to your needs. Editing theme name, Primary, Secondary colors and Typography are the same as editing these properties in New Theme.

**Note: Always check whether your brand colors (applied on Primary and Secondary color options) and their shades are visually different enough from Warning, Info, Error and Success colors.**
