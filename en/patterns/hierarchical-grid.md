## Hierarchical Grid

Use the Hierarchical Grid Pattern symbol as a starting point when designing a complex Hierarchical Grid with nested child Grids and some of its features. It provides a parent Grid and nested child Grid with an active cell and visual representation of the connection between the parent and child grids. On Hierarchical Grid can be applied all the Grid functionality, provided in the Components Library.

List of all the Grid functionality:
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Summaries
- Paging
- Editing
- Column Moving
- Column Resizing
- Column Hiding
- Display Density
- Excel Style Filtering
- GroupBy
- Pinning
- Row Selection
- Row Editing
- Active Cell
- Export
- Toolbar

All Grid features are applicable to each child and parent Grid.


> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Hierarchical Grid Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components and Grid symbols that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components and Grid symbols, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
