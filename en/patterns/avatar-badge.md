## Avatar + Badge

Use the Avatar + Badge Pattern to complement the graphical representation that the Avatar provides with a short subtle message or indication for an alert or notification.

The Avatar + Badge Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and Badge that constitute its layout.

### Size

The Avatar + Badge Pattern supports the same sizes that the Avatar does:

- Large - Suitable for profile pages
- Medium - Appropriate for custom menus and visualizations
- Small - Easily embedded in a contact list and similar repetitive scenarios

### Position

The Badge can be positioned in any of the four corners of the Avatar as shown below through the help of an override.
