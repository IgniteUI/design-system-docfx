The Image Manipulation Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and various Buttons that constitute its layout.

## Layout

The Image Manipulation Pattern supports both stadard images and Avatars that come in layouts with one or two Flat Buttons, FAB Button, or an Icon Button.
