## Image Manipulation

Use the Image Manipulation Pattern to provide a way to edit, update, modify, or perform other quick actions on an image or Avatar containing a photo.

<img src="../images/image-manip_demo.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The Image Manipulation Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and various Buttons that constitute its layout.

## Layout

The Image Manipulation Pattern supports both standard images and Avatars that come in layouts with one or two Flat Buttons, FAB Button, or an Icon Button.

<img src="../images/image-manip_layout.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_layout@2x.png 2x" />

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting an Image Manipulation Pattern and choosing the `ðŸ’¡Type` and `ðŸ’¡Layout` `Override` settings that take care of the Component displaying the image and the layout of manipulation actions, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol`. You should repeat this action two more times on the `ðŸ’¡Type` and `ðŸ’¡Layout` symbols that will be unveiled progressively in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The Components that lay out the detached `ðŸ’¡Content`, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
