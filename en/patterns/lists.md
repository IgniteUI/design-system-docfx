## Lists

Use the Lists Pattern Symbols as presets for organized collections of data in horizontal or vertical layout depicting common scenarios such as people, social media stories, multilevel list elements, settings, recently used items, products, categories of items.

### Empty State

Use the Empty State List Pattern Symbol to illustrate search with no available results.

### Group of Items

Use the Group of Items List Pattern Symbol to present grouped or organized items .

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/list_with_avatars.png" srcset="../images/list_with_avatars@2x.png 2x" />


> [!WARNING]
> After inserting any of the Lists available as a Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual List Items, as well as the background and data binding layers must stay intact and not be detached!
