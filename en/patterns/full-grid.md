## Full Grid

Use the Grid Pattern symbol as an alternative starting point when designing a table. It provides a full-blown contentwise and stylewise Grid Component that comes with all the Grid functionality, provided in the Components Library such as:

- Sorting
- Filtering
- Summaries
- Paging

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Full Grid Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
