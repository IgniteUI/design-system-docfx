## File Upload

Use the File Upload Pattern to provide the uploading and insertion mechanisms for files, images, or attachments.

<img src="../images/file-upload_demo.png" srcset="../images/file-upload_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The File Upload Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and Icon Button that constitute its layout.

### Type

The File Upload Pattern provides two types of previews for the uploaded file: an Avatar and a Document, shown in a standard image.

<img src="../images/file-upload_type.png" srcset="../images/file-upload_type@2x.png 2x" />

### Content

The File Upload Pattern supports the most common types of content that are usually uploaded or inserted as Documents: CSV, PDF, Presentation, Spreadsheet, and Text. Additionally, an Upload and Attach types are available to provide further flexibility for various appliction scenarios.

<img src="../images/file-upload_content.png" srcset="../images/file-upload_content@2x.png 2x" />

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting a File Upload Pattern and choosing the `ðŸ’¡Type` and `ðŸ’¡Content` `Override` settings that take care of the Pattern layout and default content preset, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol`. You should repeat this action two more times on the `ðŸ’¡Type` and `ðŸ’¡Content` symbols that will be unveiled progressively in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The Components that lay out the detached `ðŸ’¡Content`, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
